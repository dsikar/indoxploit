Files I found on Wordpress installation related to vulnerabilities exploited by indoxploit.

## archive.php

Replaced original archive.php in wp-content/themes/simplicitybright/ (simplicitybright theme). This will list all files in Wordpress root directory, plus options to upload, delete and change file modes. 

## .htaccess

Redirects to news.php and file.php.

## ,htaccess.ss

Probably renamed, redirect to directory ss_slash_site_path.
